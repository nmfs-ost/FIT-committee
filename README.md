# FIT-committee

Repository for the FIT committee to use for communication. May be used for:
 - Tracking elements of the FIT strategic plan
 - Other purposes the FIT committee deems relavent.

## Do I need to watch the repository?

You can, to see all the details! However, watching a repository is too much information for some people, so we should assume that not everyone is watching and use tags (e.g., @k-doering-NOAA) to make sure the intended recepient gets a notification. We will also go over important aspects of the repository in FIT meetings and over email.
